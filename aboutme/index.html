    <h2>Elias Gutierrez-Privado (The one in the middle with the fat tie)</h2>

    <p>My name is Elias and I'm 22 years old. I'm from a small town called La Grange, in North Carolina. Although<br>
        I was born here, my family are from El Salvador. We're a fmaily of six and I only have brothers! I love to <br>
        draw, read, build models, and watch movies and series.
    </p>

    <p>Technology is amazing, and I've always loved working with computers. In the past I've worked with Python so I<br>
        to learn more abou thtml and css, and everything else in between. I hope to continue to learn and improve,<br>
        and am excited for this new semester we have together.
